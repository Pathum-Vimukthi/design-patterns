# Design Patterns

This repository is dedicated to exploring and documenting various design patterns, including creational, structural, and behavioral patterns. The repository covers fundamental design patterns such as the Factory Pattern, Singleton Pattern, Facade Pattern, Adapter Pattern, Strategy Pattern, Command Pattern, and Observer Pattern, among others. Each pattern is described in detail, along with code samples and practical illustrations to aid in understanding and implementation.

## Creational Design Patterns
- **Factory Pattern:** Defines an interface for creating objects but lets subclasses decide which class to instantiate. It promotes loose coupling by eliminating the need to bind application-specific classes into the code.
- **Singleton Pattern:** Ensures a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it. It is useful when only one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system.

## Structural Design Patterns
- **Facade Pattern:** Provides a unified interface to a set of interfaces in a subsystem. It defines a higher-level interface that makes the subsystem easier to use.
- **Adapter Pattern:** Allows incompatible interfaces to work together. It acts as a bridge between the old and new interfaces, enabling the classes to work together that couldn't otherwise due to incompatible interfaces.

## Behavioural Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern:** Defines a family of algorithms, encapsulates each one, and makes them interchangeable. It lets the algorithm vary independently from the clients that use it.
- **Command Pattern:** Encapsulates a request as an object, thereby allowing for parameterization of clients with different requests, queuing of requests, and logging of requests.
- **Observer Pattern:** Defines a one-to-many dependency between objects so that when one object changes state, all its dependents are notified and updated automatically.
